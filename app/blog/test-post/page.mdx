# Testing MDX Blog Functionality

Welcome to our first blog post! This is a test to verify that MDX is working correctly with Next.js App Router.

## What is this post about?

This post isn’t just a test—it’s also a founder rant about accelerators. After years of pivoting and copy-pasting the same YC application into dozens of portals, I decided to try something different.  

So I built a **“Sh*t Blaster”** tool that submits one application to *all* accelerators at once. This post explains the problem, the hack, and the math behind it.  

## The Problem

Fill out one accelerator app, and you’ve basically filled them all:  

- Same questions  
- Same SAFE notes  
- Same exact promises of “network, mentorship, and exclusivity” (*bla bla bla*)  

Founders waste weeks repeating themselves while accelerators pretend they’re each unique.  

## The Hack

After 2 years of slogging through this, I finally snapped and hacked together a tool:  

- Upload your YC app once  
- Blast it to 20+ accelerators (and counting)  
- Save hours of tedious copy-paste  

It’s still buggy, but it works. Think of it as a “Sh*t Blaster 3000” for startup applications.  

## The Math

Here’s the reasoning:  

1. If accelerators are honest about ~1% acceptance rates...  
2. And my app is *average* (just acceptable)...  
3. Then sending more apps should statistically improve my odds.  

If my app is garbage, of course, then sending 100 copies won’t change much. But if it’s borderline, this approach might tilt the math in my favor.  

### Code Blocks (for fun)

```javascript
function acceptanceChance(appQuality, appsSent) {
  if (appQuality === "garbage") return 0;
  return 1 - Math.pow(0.99, appsSent);
}

console.log(acceptanceChance("average", 100));
// ~63% chance with 100 tries
