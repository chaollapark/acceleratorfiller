# Testing MDX Blog Functionality

Welcome to our first blog post! This is a test to verify that MDX is working correctly with Next.js App Router.

## What is this post about?

This post demonstrates:

- **Markdown rendering** - headers, lists, and text formatting
- **MDX capabilities** - the ability to use JSX components within markdown
- **Next.js App Router integration** - how MDX files work as pages

## Testing Basic Markdown

Here's some basic markdown content:

1. Ordered lists work
2. **Bold text** works
3. *Italic text* works
4. `Inline code` works

### Code Blocks

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("MDX Blog"));
```

## Interactive Content (MDX Feature)

Since this is MDX, we can include JSX components:

<div className="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-4 my-6">
  <p className="text-blue-800">
    <strong>Note:</strong> This is a custom styled callout using Tailwind classes directly in MDX!
  </p>
</div>

## Conclusion

If you can see this post with proper formatting, then the MDX blog setup is working correctly! 

The blog is now ready for:
- Writing posts in Markdown or MDX format
- Using React components within posts
- Leveraging your existing Tailwind styles
